          <p>Hi! I am Rosie Khurmi, a third-year computer science 
            student at Ontario Tech University with a 
            passion for coding, problem-solving, mathematics and learning. 
            I have been coding since high school, constantly exploring new ways 
            to use technology to solve complex problems.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>What excites me most is the thrill of solving challenging problems 
            and finding effective solutions, especially when
            they requre a technical and creative approach. I am passionate 
            about the power of learning and teaching, either to grasp new 
            concepts or share my current knowledge. I am constantly driven 
            by a curiosity for lifelong growth and learning.</p>
